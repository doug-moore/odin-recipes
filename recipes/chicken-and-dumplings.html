    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken and Dumplings start with a savory chicken soup with vegetables in a creamy broth.
        The soup is topped with uncooked dumplings that are then steamed on top.
        It is a popular comfort food in the Southern US, and can vary in terms of how thick the soup is and what kind of dumplings are used.
