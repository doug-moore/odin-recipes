# odin-recipes

Greetings! To whoever reads this, this is my first repository. While you
dig through, I hope that you can see how far my future self has come. And hopefully you devs out there can be thankful that you stuck it out, and
see how far YOU have come. Enjoy :)

###What Is This Project

The 'odin-recipes' project is a website containing links to 3 web pages   for 3 recipes.  These pages will each contain a:

*Picture

###What For?

I made this project to show my skill in HTML, uncluding:

*HTML boiler structure
*Elements containing tags, attributes, and content
*Different tags and their respected uses
*The ability to use relative and absolute links
